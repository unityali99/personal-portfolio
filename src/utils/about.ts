Greetings! I'm Ali Ahmadi, a university student at Shamsipour
Technical and Vocational College (Higher Education) with a passion
for continuous learning and software engineering, particularly in
Full-Stack development. ⚛︎ With knowledge and experience in HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, CSS preprocessors, React, and Next.js, along with
their useful and important libraries, I have a strong foundation in
front-end web development. Additionally, I am proficient in SQL and
NoSQL databases, including SQL Server, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis,
among others. 👨‍💻 While I have more experience with C#, I also have
some familiarity with PHP. I've created many web templates for my
own training, which are available on my GitHub page. I care about
basic skills like data structures, design patterns and other
important lessons which are vital for a real software engineer. 🖥️
In my spare time, I enjoy assembling and customizing PCs. I have a
solid understanding of computer hardware components and their
functions, and I enjoy keeping up with the latest technology trends.
🌐 I'm also an active member of the Persia.js community, where we
collaborate on projects and help beginners get started with web
development. I am constantly striving to learn more about the
unlimited world of software engineering, and I am dedicated to
improving my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest tools and
techniques. 🎉 As an extrovert and a friendly person, I am always
happy to help others and solve problems. I believe in treating
everyone with respect, even when we disagree. 🥋 In addition to my
work in web development and PC assembly, I am also a professional
karate ka, with honors including national and international
championships in countries such as Armenia and Malaysia. Thank you
for visiting my profile, and feel free to reach out if you have any
questions or opportunities for collaboration.🙏 github page:
